Pixel Up Image Quality Enhancer

A deep learning–based super-resolution tool that enhances low-quality images using Real-ESRGAN. This project uses a pretrained ESRGAN model to upscale and restore images with improved clarity and detail.

Features
Enhances blurry, pixelated, low-resolution images
Supports .jpg, .png, .jpeg, and more
Works with pretrained model (RealESRGAN_x4plus.pth)
Implemented in Python using PyTorch
Comes with a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) for easy execution

How to Run
1. Run in Jupyter Notebook
2. Open ESRGAN_Image_Enhancer.ipynb
3. Upload images into /input
4. Run all cells
5. Enhanced images will appear in /output
